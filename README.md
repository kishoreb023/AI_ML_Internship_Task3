# **AI & ML Internship - Task 3: Linear Regression Model**

---

## 📌 Objective
Build and evaluate a **Linear Regression** model to predict house prices based on features like area, bedrooms, bathrooms, and other factors.

---

## ✅ Key Steps
- Data loading and basic preprocessing  
- Feature selection for model building  
- Building and training a Linear Regression model  
- Evaluating the model using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R² Score**  
- Visualizing the regression results (Actual vs Predicted)  
- Analyzing residuals  
- Understanding model performance and suggesting improvements

---

## 🧰 Libraries Used
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  

---

## 📈 Results
The linear regression model demonstrated a strong relationship between house features and their corresponding prices.  
The model’s evaluation metrics indicate good predictive performance and important insights were drawn about key influencing features.
